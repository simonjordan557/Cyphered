# Cyphered

### WORK IN PROGRESS

**This project is in active development and is not yet fit for use! There are many many many hours of debugging ahead.**

A console application written in C#, to encrypt and decrypt messages.

- Encrypt and decrypt text using a unique key.
- Read in text from a file, or from the keyboard.
- Use your own key, or generate a random one.
- Encrypt your key to send to your buddy! (DON'T SEND THE KEY WITH THE MESSAGE IT UNLOCKS!)
- Password protection to help protect your key.

Future Features:

- Better encryption using Binary Formatter.
- Option of substitution for non-alpha characters (more secure, but this makes it less human-readable so less fun!)

Foundation For Future Projects:

- Brute force decryption program when key not available - i.e. How to crack Enigma!
